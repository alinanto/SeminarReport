\section*{DECLARATION\centering}
   	I undersigned hereby declare that the Seminar report ``Impedance-Based Battery Management System For Safety Monitoring Of Lithium-Ion Battery", submitted for partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of degree of Bachelor of Technology of the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, Kerala is a bonafide work done by me under supervision of Prof. Uma Syamkumar and Dr. Ramesh Kumar P. This submission represents my ideas in my own words and where ideas or words of others have been included, I have adequately and accurately cited and referenced the original sources. I also declare that I have adhered to ethics of academic honesty and integrity and have not misrepresented or fabricated any data or idea or fact or source in my submission. I understand that any violation of the above will be a cause for disciplinary action by the institute and/or the University and can also evoke penal action from the sources which have thus not been properly cited or from whom proper permission has not been obtained. This report has not been previously formed the basis for the award of any degree, diploma or similar title of any other University. \\

\begin{abstract}
Multi-frequency impedance measurements have been recognized as a technique for the
monitoring of individual calls in Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. However, its practical
introduction for battery management has been slow, mainly due to added size and larger
operating power requirements. Here, we describe a small, low-power, multi-frequency (1-1000
Hz) impedance-based battery management system (BMS) for multi-cell batteries of varying
capacities. This BMS ensures battery safety and efficiency by tracking and acting on emerging
mismatches and other electrical and thermal abnormalities in each individual cell without adding
cost, volume, weight and power, compared to conventional BMSs. Multi-cell batteries face a
unique problem that single cell Li-ion batteries do not: mismatching of one or more cells is
detrimental to the safety and efficiency of the entire battery. Thus, cell matching is an important
first step required for safe operation of multi-cell Li-ion batteries. Cell mismatch can occur due
to battery over-discharge, overcharge, internal and external shorts, etc., or even when leaving a
battery unused for an extended period (calendar aging). Predicting a mismatch is essential for a
batteryâ€™s thermal safety and electrical efficiency. Conventional BMSs typically monitor cell
voltages and surface temperature. However, these measurements and related protocols have not
succeeded in ensuring battery safety or improving efficiency. Data for batteries with intentionally
calendar-aged and over-discharged cells convincingly demonstrate that such BMSs cannot
identify cell mismatches and emerging failures. In contrast, the impedance-based BMS,
described here, tracks, identifies, and acts on changes in the internal state of each cell
continuously in real time, including battery charging, discharging, and at rest.
